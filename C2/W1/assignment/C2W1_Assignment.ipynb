    "Welcome to this assignment! In this week you will be using the famous `cats vs dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this you will create your own Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities.\n",
